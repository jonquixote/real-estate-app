## Investment Metrics

The platform uses several key metrics to evaluate investment properties:

### Rent 1% Rule

The Rent 1% Rule states that a property's monthly rent should be at least 1% of its purchase price.

**Formula**: (Monthly Rent / Property Price) * 100 ≥ 1%

**Example**: A $200,000 property should rent for at least $2,000 per month to meet the 1% rule.

### Sqft 1% Rule

The Sqft 1% Rule states that a property's square footage should be at least 1% of its purchase price.

**Formula**: (Square Footage / Property Price) * 100 ≥ 1%

**Example**: A $200,000 property should have at least 2,000 square feet to meet the 1% rule.

### Cash-on-Cash Return

Cash-on-Cash Return measures the annual return on the cash invested in a property.

**Formula**: (Annual Cash Flow / Total Cash Invested) * 100

**Example**: If you invested $50,000 and the annual cash flow is $5,000, the Cash-on-Cash Return is 10%.

### Cap Rate

Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate) measures a property's annual return independent of financing.

**Formula**: (Net Operating Income / Property Value) * 100

**Example**: If a $200,000 property has a Net Operating Income of $16,000, the Cap Rate is 8%.
